        not all automation is created equal
        <aside class="notes">
            not every playbook is a good playbook
            you have to maintain and fix issues that manifest through wider adoption in your company
            the amount of playbooks increases and maintainability goes down
            hardly any playbook shares code with other playbook since no generall purpose roles have been written
            we need need to seperate our logic into roles
