            not all automation is created equal
            <aside class="notes">
                not every playbook is a good playbook
                you have to maintain and fix issues that manifest through wider adoption in your company
                the amount of playbooks increases and maintainability goes down
                hardly any playbook shares code with other playbook since no generall purpose roles have been written
                we need need to seperate our logic into roles

                ansible galaxy
                Ansible is a handy configuration management tool as we have already looked here. 
                It helps in configuring large number of the servers from one single controller instance. 
                It helps automate complex tasks like configuration management, application deployment, creating CI/CD pipeline etc. 
                Writing ansible code to manage the same service for multiple environments or different products increase code redundancy. 
                With more complexity in functionality, it becomes difficult to manage everything in one ansible playbook file. 
                Sharing code among teams become difficult. Ansible Role helps solve these problems. 
                Ansible role is an independent component which allows reuse of common configuration steps. 
                Ansible role has to be used within playbook. 
                Ansible role is a set of tasks to configure a host to serve a certain purpose like configuring a service. 
                Roles are defined using YAML files with a predefined directory structure.
